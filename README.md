# CIFAR-10 Image Prediction
A simple interface over a Convolution Neural Network which allows you to give any image to the model and obtain predictions. The model has been inspired from VGG-19 and is a very stripped down and simplified version of the same.

The model has an accuracy of `73%`.

>**Note:** This is an old project and **will not work with `tensorflow >= 2.16`**. It was last tested and found to be working with **`tensorflow==2.14`**. Sample images are in `images/` and screenshots of the project in action in `outputs/`.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/B4S1C-Coder/CIFAR-10-Image-Prediction.git`

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended), if needed.

3. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. You should now be good to go.

5. Run the project via `python interface.py`
